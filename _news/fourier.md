Excited to share that [Matt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G2Cc0okAAAAJ&hl=en)'s paper _"Fourier diffusion models: A method to control mtf and nps in score-based stochastic image generation_" has been accepted to [IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10937272). It was a great collaboration!
