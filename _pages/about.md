I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Johns Hopkins University, where I am honored to be advised by [Jeremias Sulam](https://sites.google.com/view/jsulam) and to be affiliated with the [Mathematical Institute for Data Science](https://www.minds.jhu.edu/). Prior to joining JHU, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering at [Politecnico di Torino, Italy](https://www.polito.it/).

My research focuses on:

- Formal machine learning explainability,
- Uncertainty quantification,
- Weakly supervised learning for medical imaging.

In the past, I have worked with [Rhonda Dzakpasu](https://physics.georgetown.edu/rhonda-dzakpasu/) in the Department of Physics at Georgetown University to study spontaneous activity of *in vitro*, embryonal neural-astrocyte networks.
