Hi! I am Jacopo, a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Johns Hopkins University, where I work with [Jeremias Sulam](https://sites.google.com/view/jsulam) and the [Mathematical Institute for Data Science](https://www.minds.jhu.edu/). I came to Baltimore from [Politecnico di Torino, Italy](https://www.polito.it/), where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering. 

I am passionate about building AI systems we can actually trust—especially when people's health is on the line. My research develops statistical methods that help us understand when and why AI works (or does not!).

**What keeps me up at night:**

- **Interpretability:** I use tools like conditional independence testing, sequential testing, and the Shapley value to understand what drives AI decisions.
- **Uncertainty quantification:** I work on conformal prediction and conformal risk control for generative systems.
- **AI for scientific discovery:** I study how AI agents can accelerate molecular and protein design.

I have had the privilege of interning at [Polymathic AI](https://polymathic-ai.org/) (2025), [Profluent](https://www.profluent.bio/) (2023), and [nference](https://nference.com/) (2021), where I got to see these challenges play out in real-world scenarios. Before going into machine learning, I worked with [Rhonda Dzakpasu](https://physics.georgetown.edu/rhonda-dzakpasu/) at Georgetown University studying the development of *in-vitro* neural-astrocyte networks (the real, biological kind!).
